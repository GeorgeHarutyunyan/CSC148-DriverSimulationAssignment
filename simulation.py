    Of course, you may add whatever private attributes and methods you want.
    But because you should not change the interface, you may not add any public
    attributes or methods.
    This is the entry point into your program, and in particular is used for
    auto-testing purposes. This makes it ESSENTIAL that you do not change the
    interface in any way!
